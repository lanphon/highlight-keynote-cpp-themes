# Introduction

This small project is used to show the effects of  different themes for
highlight tool on Keynote, with CPP code sample.

In fact, it's more like a physical work. A final result keynote document
is presented here, to let me brower different themes of highligh on
a back ground to pick up my favourite. It's also convenient to change the back
ground by replacing a new keynote template.

Anyway, enjoy it.
